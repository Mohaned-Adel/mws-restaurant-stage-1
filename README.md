## App Overview

In this project, a static webpage that lacks accessibility is given to be converted into a mobile-ready web application. The design must be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. It will also be added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

### What do I do from here?

1. Download as .zip file or clone this project:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/Mohaned-Adel/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git
    ```

2. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. In order to view the project in the browser, you can download, install and run lite-server and then navigate to http://localhost:3000/ . I am also running Browsersync .

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. 

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
